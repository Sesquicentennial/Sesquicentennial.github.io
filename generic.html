			<p>Nayely worked on the Android team, creating the initial wireframes and hashing out the
				events calendar feature. A CS major by day and avid jigsaw puzzler by night, Nayely can
				either be found frantically sending out CSA Senate emails or printing out inspirational
				quotes to plaster on her wall.</p>

			<p>Sherry is a studio art and computer science double major, born in Shanghai, China. She
				does not do graphic design. She likes algorithms, debugging and building things up. Three
				things she wants to do the most recently are: get a skydiving license, have a cat, and
				farm in New Zealand. </p>
