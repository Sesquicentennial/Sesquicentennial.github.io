            <h2>During the 2016-2017 school year, Carleton College will be
                celebrating its 150th anniversary</h2>
				<p>As part of this celebration, the Sesquicentennial mobile app will guide users
					through an exploration of the college’s rich and unique history, as well as provide
					social networking features to bring users together in this remarkable occasion. The
					app’s ultimate purpose is to serve as an interactive guide that enables visitors to
					the college to immerse themselves in Carleton’s past and present through interactive
					features, while offering practical resources to navigate today’s campus. Designed
					for a wide audience, including alumni, parents, prospective students, and general
					college visitors, the app is available for both Android and iOS devices. The
					features that are provided with the app are described below.</p>

					The Quests feature provides an interactive way of exploring the campus. After
					selecting a quest, you must decipher a series of clues by determining what location
					on campus they refer to. After walking to that location on campus, the app will
					detect your location on campus and let you know if you are at the correct location.
					Hints are provided in case you get stuck!

					or at a cafe in Edinburgh on your Carleton study abroad trip, share those moments
