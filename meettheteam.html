            Chet is originally from Pella, Iowa, and at some point after became a computer science major and ended up working on the server and iOS portions of this project. A self-proclaimed music nerd, he will be working at Pandora next year with the Music Industry team, which creates AMP and other initiatives for artists. When not pressing keys, you might find him playing cello or bicycling.

			<p>Sherry is a studio art and computer science double major, born in Shanghai, China. She
				does not do graphic design. She likes algorithms, debugging and building things up. Three
				things she wants to do the most recently are: get a skydiving license, have a cat, and
				farm in New Zealand. </p>

			Haley Hinze was born in Cascade, Idaho, a booming metropolis with a population exceeding 900 people. She worked mainly on the Android portion of this project, focusing on the History, Quests, and Memories features. When she isn’t holed up frantically pounding away at her worn-out keyboard she can be found skiing, ice skating, or backpacking in the wilderness because 900 people isn’t quite few enough. Haley has followed in the footsteps of her childhood hero Smokey the Bear and lives on top of a mountain looking for wildfires to report as part of her summer job as a fire lookout.

			<p>Nayely worked on the Android team, creating the initial wireframes and hashing out the
				events calendar feature. A CS major by day and avid jigsaw puzzler by night, Nayely can
				either be found frantically sending out CSA Senate emails or printing out inspirational
				quotes to plaster on her wall.</p>
